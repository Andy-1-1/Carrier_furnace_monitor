Furnace Status Light Monitor
by Andy Fraser, 1 March 2023

An Arduino can be used to monitor the status lamp on a machine (a Carrier 59TP6B
furnace in this case), and report when a fault happens and what kind of fault
happened, by decoding the fault code flashed by that status lamp.

The project is described in my article on Medium at the link below.  If you're not
a Medium subscriber you can read three articles a month for free, but it's
worth joining!  If you choose a paid instead of free membership, please use my referral
link at the end of the article, I'll get a portion of your membership fee, which 
I then spend on hardware and parts for more projects :)

Caution: this is for watching, decoding, and logging the status light on a furnace.
Do not try and fix or adjust the furnace.  Do not open it to observe or measure 
more details. For example, if you open it and don't seal it again properly, or try
and measure airflow of the intake or exhaust and the setup fails and obstructs it,
you risk carbon monoxide poisoning, which often leads to death.  
Observe and measure from the outside only :)
